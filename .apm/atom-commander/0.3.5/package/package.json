More features will be added in time, but the primary focus is to provide a way to browse the file system in a way that's familiar to many people.\n\n## Buttons\nButton|Action\n---|---\nF2 Rename|Rename the highlighted file or folder.\nF3 Add Project|Add the highlighted or selected folders as project folders to the workspace.

Releasing the key will close the menu again.\n\n![Screenshot](https://github.com/morassman/atom-commander/blob/master/resources/quick_menu.png?raw=true)\n\nThe menus are shown at the top of the panel in the form of buttons. Each button is numbered. Pressing the corresponding number will open that menu. Since these are buttons they can be clicked on as well.\n\nEntering a menu will show its items and potential sub menus. These are also numbered. There is also an extra button on the left to return to the parent menu. The keys `0`, `Escape` and `Shift` are all valid keys for returning to the parent menu.\n\nWhen the menu is closed and opened again it will start on the root menu.\n\n### Available Menus\n1. **Select**\n  1. **All** : Select everything.\n  2. **None** : Deselect everything.\n  3. **Add** : Select items with a pattern.\n  4. **Remove** : Deselect items with a pattern.\n  5. **Invert** : Invert the selection.\n  6. **Folders** : Add folders to selection.\n  7. **Files** : Add files to selection.\n2. **Go**\n  1. **Project** : Go to the project folder.\n  2. **Editor** : Go to the file that is active in the editor.\n  3. **Drive** : Go to a specific drive.\n  4. **Root** : Go to the root folder.\n  5. **Home** : Go to your user folder.\n3. **Bookmarks**\n  1. **Add** : Add a bookmark.\n  2. **Remove** : Remove bookmarks.\n  3. **Open** : Open a bookmark.\n4. **View**\n  1. **Mirror** : Show the same folder in the other pane as the focused one.\n  2. **Swap** : Swap the two folders.\n5. **Compare**\n  1. **Folders** : Select the differences between the two folders.\n  2. **Files** : Show the difference between the left and right highlighted files.\n\n## Bookmarks\nBookmarks allow for quick navigation to both files and folders.\n\n### Adding Bookmarks\nBookmarks can be added from either the menu in Atom Commander or by choosing `Atom Commander: Add Bookmark` from the Command Palette. If the menu is used then the a bookmark will be added for the item that is currently highlighted. If the Command Palette is used and the editor has focus then a bookmark will be added for the file currently being edited.\n\nWhen a bookmark is added a name for it can be entered. This is optional and may be left empty.\n\n### Opening Bookmarks\nThe list of bookmarks can be opened from either the menu in Atom Commander or by choosing `Atom Commander: Open Bookmark` from the Command Palette. The list can be filtered on both the name and path. When a bookmark for a file is opened the file will be opened in the editor and it will be shown in Atom Commander. If the bookmark is for a folder then the folder will be shown.\n\n### Removing Bookmarks\nThe list of bookmarks can be opened from either the menu in Atom Commander or by choosing `Atom Commander: Remove Bookmark` from the Command Palette. Each bookmark that is selected will be removed. The list will remain open until it is cancelled by pressing the `Escape` key.\n\n## Compare\n### Folders\nWhen the left and right folders are compared then everything that is in the one, but not in the other will be selected. This will replace the current selection.\n### Files\nThis is still experimental. Performing this action will open a side-by-side view that will compare the file highlighted on the left with the one highlighted on the right.\n\n![Screenshot](https://github.com/morassman/atom-commander/blob/master/resources/diff.png?raw=true)\n\nLines that have been added are highlighted on the left whereas lines that have been removed are highlighted on the right. The remaining lines are those that the files have in common. Clicking on a common section will highlight it and its counterpart on the other side.\n\nThe files are currently not being monitored for changes. If either of the files change then the comparison will have to be done again.\n\n## Todo\n- Load directories asynchronously.\n- Give visual feedback for file system operations.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/morassman/atom-commander/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/morassman/atom-commander#readme","_id":"atom-commander@0.3.5","_shasum":"245c2de004cb8d8bbfb7de4f0ca235626ca2e772","_resolved":"file:../d-11594-20532-1jex76o/package.tgz","_from":"../d-11594-20532-1jex76o/package.tgz"}
